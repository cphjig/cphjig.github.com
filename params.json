This would be both \"full stack\" – meaning everything from type theory to mechanical sympathy and JVM internals – and polyglot in the sense that any programming language that runs on or is somehow involved with the JVM, would be welcome.\r\n\r\n * The meet-up starts at 17:00\r\n * Presentations are usually in Danish\r\n * Presentations can be anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour long\r\n\r\n### Schedule\r\n\r\nNext meet-up is November 28, 17:00 at Schantz, Kigkurren 10, DK-2300 København S.\r\n\r\n * [ScalaCheck](https://github.com/rickynils/scalacheck), by [Mads Hartmann](https://twitter.com/Mads_Hartmann)\r\n * Optimising [Stormpot](http://chrisvest.github.com/stormpot/), by [Christian Vest Hansen](https://twitter.com/chvest)\r\n * *More speakers wanted.
